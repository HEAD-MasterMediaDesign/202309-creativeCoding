Unnoticed is a project focused on the unseen. During our explorations in Chamonix, France, we gathered various types of data related to our interests. This includes audio recordings of radio waves, photographs of warning signs from all over Chamonix, and close-up images of details from rocks, moss, pavement, and insects.

Our initial concept was to create an unconventional map. We delved into how contemporary artists approach mapping and aimed to chart elements typically absent from traditional maps. In the creative coding aspect, we explored ways to make our map interactive and immersive. As the background, we utilised an approximate 3D terrain rendering from Google Maps, which possessed an intriguing style while effectively representing the terrain.

To engage with our project, you can use a wireless trackpad to adjust your position on the map. While navigating our map, you will hear sounds that indicate the locations of points of interest. These points remain invisible, but as you approach them, the sound amplifies until it unveils a composite scene: a picture of a warning sign superimposed with close-up texture details. This creates a surprising and somewhat alarming atmosphere. Once you move past these points, the sound volume decreases, allowing you to continue your map exploration at ease.
