ON DIRAIT UNE CARTE POSTALE (Katya Bliznyak, Dasha Kotova, Jasmine Molano)

Chamonix, born from the Alpine culture around Mont Blanc, exists as a living postcard thriving through tourism. The aim of the project is to reflect on the metamorphosis of Chamonix, where natural beauty has fallen victim to man's desire for consumption and exploitation. Using our findings in the area, we aim to create a future image of Chamonix in the form of a postcard.

Each postcard consists of four layers. The first layer is the sky made of artificial textures that we found or observed in Chamonix. The second layer comprises mountain outlines taken from real postcards bought in local souvenir shops. These mountains are reconstructed with trash samples collected on the hiking paths. The third layer shows figures of tourists taking selfies, thus emphasizing the idea of a shift in values, where it is now more important to "mark" being in a place as opposed to actually enjoying its beauty. The last layer consists of text made from randomly selected words from interviews with locals and tourists in Chamonix, who had contrasting views on the current situation in the region. Each layer is randomly generated and can be changed with a separate keyboard key.
